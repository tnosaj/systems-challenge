## Part 1: Configuration Management
```
Given the description provided at the beginning of the challenge, the tasks to
be completed in this part are:

- Containerize `cabify` service using Docker.
- Manage the service discovery of the service using Consul.
- Improve the service balancing strategy using HAProxy. There are
   many solutions for this task, some of them combine HAProxy with other
   technologies and you are allowed to do so.

The result of the assignment should have at least two instances of the Cabify
service running and should be accessible from the host via curl just like in
the example above.
```




## Part 2: Questions

```
- Identify the SPOFs in the result of the assignment and explain how you would
  solve them.
```
  

  
```
- Explain how would you upgrade the Cabify service without downtime. We
  would like to have a short term solution, something that in the real world
  you would be able to deliver the same day or week. Then provide an
  explanation for a more complex solution where you improve the state of this
  assignment to your ideal release management process.
